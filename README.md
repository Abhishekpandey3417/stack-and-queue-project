# Stack and Queue Operations

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Stack** and **Queue** data structures using the C programming language.
It includes common operations such as insertion, deletion, display, and error handling for overflow and underflow conditions.

## üìå Project Features

### Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)
- Push (insert an element)
- Pop (remove top element)
- Peek (view top element)
- Display Stack
- Stack Overflow/Underflow detection

### Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)
- Enqueue (insert an element)
- Dequeue (remove front element)
- Peek (view front element)
- Display Queue
- Queue Overflow/Underflow detection

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Language: C
- Concepts: Array and Pointer-based Stack & Queue
- Compiler: GCC or Turbo C / Dev-C++
